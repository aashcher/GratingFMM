%% scattering matrix calculation

%% diffraction of a plane wave example
V_dif = zeros(no,2); % allocate a vector of diffracted field amplitudes
	% apply the calculated scattering matrix to the incident vector:
V_dif(:,1) = SM(:,:,1,1)*V_inc(:,1) + SM(:,:,1,2)*V_inc(:,2); % diffraction to the substrate
V_dif(:,2) = SM(:,:,2,1)*V_inc(:,1) + SM(:,:,2,2)*V_inc(:,2); % diffraction to the superstrate
  % check the power conservation
b = fmm_balance(no,V_inc,V_dif,kx0,kg,eps_sub,eps_sup,pol);

	% calculate the vector of diffraction efficiencies

%% description:
% T-matrix of an interface between a photonic crystal and a homogeneous medium
% the case of the collinear diffraction on 1D gratings
%% input:
% no: number of Fourier harmonics
% EV: matrix of the electric field eigenvectors for the photonic crystal
% HV: matrix of the magnetic field eigenvectors for the photonic crystal
% kz: row of plane wave propagation constants in the homogeneous medium
% eps: permittivity the homogeneous medium
% pol: polarization
%% output:
% T: T-matrix of size 4*no by 4*no
%% implementation:
function [T] = fmm_calc_T(no, EV, HV, kz, eps, pol)
	T = zeros(2*no,2*no);
	ib1 = [1:no];
	ib2 = [no+1:2*no];
	if strcmp(pol,'TE')
		ikz = transpose(0.5./kz);
		T(ib1,ib1) = -HV.*ikz;
		T(ib2,ib1) = 0.5*EV - T(ib1,ib1);
		T(ib1,ib1) = T(ib1,ib1) + 0.5*EV;
		T(ib1,ib2) = T(ib2,ib1);
		T(ib2,ib2) = T(ib1,ib1);
	elseif strcmp(pol,'TM')
		eikz = transpose((0.5*eps)./kz);
		T(ib1,ib1) = EV.*eikz;
		T(ib2,ib1) = 0.5*HV - T(ib1,ib1);
		T(ib1,ib1) = T(ib1,ib1) + 0.5*HV;
		T(ib1,ib2) = -T(ib2,ib1);
		T(ib2,ib2) = -T(ib1,ib1);

%% description:
% calculate a matrix of diffraction efficiencies in case of the
% diffraction by 2D gratings being periodic in two dimensions
%% input:
% no1, no2: numbers of Fourier harmonics in x and y dimensions
% V_inc: incident field amplitude matrix of size (2*no,2)
% V_dif: diffracted field amplitude matrix of size (2*no,2)
% kx0, ky0: incident plane wave wavevector x and y projections (Bloch wavevector projections)
% kg1, kg2: wavelength-to-period ratios (grating vectors)
% psi: angle between periodicity directions (first direction is supposed 
%  to be parallel to axis X)
% eps1, eps2: substrate and superstrate permittivities
%% output:
% V_eff: efficiency matrix of size (2*no,2) if the if the incident field has
%  propagating harmonics, otherwise (if the incident field is purely evanescent)
%  the matrix of partial powers carried by each diffraction order
% first index of V_inc, V_dif, V_eff indicates diffraction harmonics
%   with indices 1:no being TE orders and no+1:2*no being TM orders
%  (0-th order index is ind_0 = (ceil(xno/2)-1)*yno+ceil(yno/2))
% second index of V_inc, V_dif, V_eff indicates whether the diffraction orders
%  are in the substrate (V(:,1)) or in the superstrate (V(:,2))
%% implementation
